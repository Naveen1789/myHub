The project1.m file wraps up all the calls to other functions and .m files.
This function takes no arguements but print out the following expected values :

	M_cfs		Optimal model complextity derived from Closed Form Solution
	lambda_cfs	Optimal Lambda derived from the Closed Form Solution
	rms_cfs		Optimal ERM derived from testing the Testing data ( using the Closed Form Solution )

	M_gd		Optimal model complextity derived from Stochastic Gradient Descent
	lambda_gd	Optimal Lambda derived from Stochastic Gradient Descent
	rms_gd		Optimal ERM derived from testing the Testing data ( using Stochastic Gradient Descent )


train_cfs.m -	The train_cfs function takes no arguements, but returns the optimal M ( Model complexity ) and Lambda values.
		The optimal W ( Weight Paramaters ), Mean Vector, S values are stored in the following files W_cfs, mu_cfs, s_cfs.

test_cfs.m -	The test_cfs function takes in 4 arguements derived from the above fuction ( optimal values of W, M, Lambda and S) 
		and computes the ERMS for the Testing data and return sthis value.

train_gd.m -	The train_gd function takes optimal values of M and S derived from the train_cfs function and 
		returns the optimal values of M, Lambda and W.
		The optimal W ( Weight Paramaters ), Mean Vector, S values are stored in the following files W_gd, mu_gd, s_gd.

test_gd.m -	The test_gd function takes in 4 arguements ( optimal values of W, M, Lambda and S) 
		and computes the ERMS for the Testing data and return sthis value.
